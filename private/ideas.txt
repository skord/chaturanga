Ideas:
  Add invites
  Scope rooms by invitees / owner
  Infinite history via scrolling (http://stackoverflow.com/questions/15324350/how-to-make-meteor-reactive-on-sub-items-but-not-parent)

Bugs:
  Creating and/or renaming a room doubles up the roster
  Creating the default rooms -- who is the owner? Chicken / Egg
  Make editing room names more evident
